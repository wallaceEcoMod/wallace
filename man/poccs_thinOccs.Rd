\title{poocs_thinOccs Thin occurrences}
\usage{
poccs_thinOccs(occs, thinDist, logger = NULL, spN = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{occs}{data frame of cleaned occurrences obtained from component occs:
Obtain occurrence data}

\item{thinDist}{distance in kilometers to be used for thinning. Number must be
positive.}

\item{logger}{Stores all notification messages to be displayed in the Log
Window of Wallace GUI. Insert the logger reactive list here for running
in shiny, otherwise leave the default NULL.}

\item{spN}{data frame of cleaned occurrences obtained from component occs:
Obtain occurrence data. Used to obtain species name for logger messages.}
}
\value{
Output is a data frame of thinned occurences (all occurences at a
  distance >thinDist) with the same columns as occs
}
\description{
The function thins the observed occurrences by a user provided
  distance.
}
\details{
This function is called by the component poccs: process occurrence data to
  thin the occurrence data to a user specified distance. Providing an output
  with preserved columns appropriate for further analyses and a maximized
  number of occurrences that are separated by at least the provided distance.

\examples{
occs <- read.csv(system.file("extdata/Bassaricyon_neblina.csv",
                             package = "wallace"))
occs$occID <- 1:nrow(occs)
out.thin <- poccs_thinOccs(occs = occs, thinDist = 30)
