#### WORKFLOW

*Wallace* (v2.1.0) currently includes ten components, or steps of a possible workflow. Each component includes two or more modules, which are possible analyses for that step.  

**Components:**  

**1.** *Obtain Occurrence Data*  
- Query Present Database 
- User-specified Occurrences

**2.** *Obtain Environmental Data*  
- WorldClim
- EcoClimate
- User-specified Environmental Data

**3.** *Process Occurrence Data*  
- Select Occurrences on Map  
- Remove Occurrences by ID  
- Spatial Thin  

**4.** *Process Environmental Data*  
- Select Study Region by Extent
- Draw Study Region
- User-specified Study Region  

**5.** *Characterize Environmental Space*  
- Environmental Ordination  
- Occurrence Density Grid  
- Niche Overlap  

**6.** *Partition Occurrence Data*  
- Non-spatial Partition  
- Spatial Partition  

**7.** *Build and Evaluate Niche Model*  
- Maxent  
- BIOCLIM  

**8.** *Visualize Model Results*  
- Map Prediction  
- Maxent Evaluation Plots  
- Plot Response Curves  
- BIOCLIM Envelope Plots  

**9.** *Model Transfer*  
- Transfer to New Extent
