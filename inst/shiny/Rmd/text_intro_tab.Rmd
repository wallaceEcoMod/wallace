- EcoClimate
- User-specified Environmental Data

**3.** *Process Occurrence Data*  
- Select Occurrences on Map  
- Remove Occurrences by ID  
- Spatial Thin  

**4.** *Process Environmental Data*  
- Select Study Region by Extent
- Draw Study Region
- User-specified Study Region  

**5.** *Characterize Environmental Space*  
- Environmental Ordination
