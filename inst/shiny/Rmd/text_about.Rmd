### **What is *Wallace*?**  

<img src="logo.png" alt="logo" style="width: 150px; float:right; padding:10px;"/>

Welcome to *Wallace*, a flexible application for reproducible ecological modeling, built for community expansion. The current version of *Wallace* (v2.1.0) steps the user through a full niche/distribution modeling analysis, from data acquisition to visualizing results.

The application is written in `R` with the web app development package `shiny`. Please find the stable version of *Wallace* on <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wallace" target="_blank">CRAN</a>, and the development version on <a href="https://github.com/wallaceEcoMod/wallace" target="_blank">Github</a>. We also maintain a *Wallace* <a href="https://wallaceecomod.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a> that has some basic info, links, and will be updated with tutorial materials in the near future.

*Wallace* is designed to facilitate spatial biodiversity research, and currently concentrates on modeling species niches and distributions using occurrence datasets and environmental predictor variables. These models provide an estimate of the species' response to environmental conditions, and can be used to generate maps that indicate suitable areas for the species (i.e. its potential geographic distribution; Guisan & Thuiller 2005; Elith & Leathwick 2009; Franklin 2010a; Peterson et al. 2011). This research area has grown tremendously over the past two decades, with applications to pressing environmental issues such as conservation biology (Franklin 2010b), invasive species (Ficetola et al. 2007), zoonotic diseases (González et al. 2010), and climate-change impacts (Kearney et al. 2010).

### **Who is *Wallace* for?**  

We engineered *Wallace* to be used by a broad audience that includes graduate students, ecologists, conservation practitioners, natural resource managers, educators, and programmers. Anyone, regardless of programming ability, can use *Wallace* to perform an analysis, learn about the methods, and share the results. Additionally, those who want to disseminate a technique can author a module for *Wallace*. 

### **Attributes of _Wallace_**

* **accessible**: lowers barriers to implement cutting-edge SDM techniques, offers support through various networks (Google Group, email, etc.)

* **open**: the code is free to use and modify (GPL 3.0), and it gives users access to some of the largest public online biodiversity databases

* **expandible**: users can author and contribute modules that enable new methodological options

* **flexible**: options for user uploads and downloads of results

* **interactive**: includes an embedded zoomable `leaflet` map, sortable `DF` data tables, and visualizations of results

* **instructive**: features guidance text that educates users about theoretical and analytical aspects of each step in the workflow

* **reproducible**: users can download an `rmarkdown` .Rmd file that when run reproduces the analysis, ability to save sessions and load later

Mahmoud Shahin designed the WallaceEcoMod logo with inspiration from “Wallace’s butterfly” (*Ornithoptera croesus*; Wallace’s golden birdwing), an idea first suggested by Samuel Chang.
