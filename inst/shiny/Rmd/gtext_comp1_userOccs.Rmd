### **Module:** ***User-specified Occurrences*** 

**BACKGROUND**  

Users may want to use species occurrence data that they have compiled themselves in the *Wallace* analysis. Such data must have assigned georeferences in decimal degrees (i.e., latitude/longitude coordinates).

**IMPLEMENTATION** 

Users may upload a .csv file of occurrence records with rows of localities, and the first three fields must be named "name" (the species name, which must be the same for all rows), "longitude", and "latitude" (in that order, with those names). Other fields can appear after these mandatory fields, but they are not used in the analysis.
