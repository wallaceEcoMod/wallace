### **Module: Upload User Prediction**

**BACKGROUND**

Here, you have the option to upload an SDM that you already made to use for downstream components. 

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Make sure any model you upload in User SDM is projected and has the same name as the scientific name of your species occurrence csv file as in "Genus_species.tif".
Note that some downstream modules (Mask - add polygon and changeRR - area calculations) require thresholded sdms instead of continuous predictions.
